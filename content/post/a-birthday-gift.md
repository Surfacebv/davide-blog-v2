I turn 35 today.

It feels both early and late in my life. But in the  likely case  I'm mostly just late, here’s a present for myself: a commitment to write and publish a blog post every week.

Writing   unscrambles my thinking, energizes me, and helps me make sense of the world: I write about tech, marketing, information and attention flows, and how these affect our inner lives.

But most of those words never escape the gravitational pull of my private notes app: I  don’t publish them. Here I am,  linked up to 3.8 billion people and counting, on a network designed expressly to make words and images flow, and I don’t even have a blog. Pretty silly.

In his book [The Gift](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-World/dp/0307279502/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=ET7ACV39RPR2Q3H1PYCS), Lewis Hyde says that in order to fulfill its purpose, creative work needs to be let go, to flow and be given away:

> *“whatever we have been given is supposed to be given away again, not kept. Or, if it is kept, something of similar value should move on in its stead…The only essential is this: the gift must always move. There are other forms of property that stand still, that mark a boundary or resist momentum, but the gift keeps going.”*

So bon voyage to this first clump of words 🎁
