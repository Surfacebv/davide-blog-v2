The founder of [Stripe](https://stripe.com) asked the following question on Twitter the other day: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Where do you most often come across interesting ideas—especially weird or surprising ones?</p>&mdash; Patrick Collison (<a href="https://twitter.com/@patrickc">@patrickc</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/967548201615044608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2018</a></blockquote>

I answered with a [short list](https://twitter.com/daveeday/status/967563298773323776) of techniques I use, which seemed to resonate with his very smart following. In fact, I'm mostly writing this post to let you know that [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) liked my tweet.

But I digress. 

Here are the 5 techniques I use to consistently stumble onto interesting ideas:  

1. **Libraries/bookstores**: the trick here is to stay away from the sections I would usually gravitate towards. I wander through the stacks, pick up a book, or even better a trade magazine, on something I know nothing about (e.g. agricultural biotechnology, Iranian philosophy) and leaf through it randomly until I see something that piques my interest.

2. **Google Images**: I will often grapple with abstract concepts I can't quite wrap my head around, or just want to understand better (e.g. [cryptographic hashes](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1319&bih=718&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=FEWSWve8OML4_AbkmrX4Bw&q=cryptographic+hash), or [mental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model)). Running a Google Image search of that phrase shows me all sorts of visual interpretations of that concept, helping me see it from many different angles. Another idea is to [run that search in different languages](https://twitter.com/adgro/status/968039298334371840) to see different cultural takes on the concept. 
3. **Museums**: any stroll around a gallery or museum will help me shake things up, but I find that catalogues of past exhibitions work particularly well. Every single exhibition was carefully designed by expert curators to offer new perspectives, and many of them (like [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/history?=undefined&page=&direction=fwd)'s or many of the [Guggenheim](https://archive.org/details/guggenheimmuseum)'s) are available online.
4. **Twitter / Instagram**: I try to follow accounts that offer me a window into fields or parts of the world I know very little about. This is a technique I carry over from my days in journalism, when I used to try and follow trade or local publications to spot stories ahead of the competition. Here are a few good ones to follow on [VR](https://twitter.com/kentbye), [complex systems](https://twitter.com/MelMitchell1), [Francophone Africa](https://twitter.com/jeune_afrique), [Sovereign Wealth Funds,](https://twitter.com/swfinstitute) [renewable energy](https://twitter.com/Sustainable2050), [birds](https://www.instagram.com/gourmetbiologist/).
5. **Brute force**: most ideas I encounter and recognize are already somewhat latent in my brain. One way to access those is to sit down with pen and paper and force yourself to write out 10, 20 or 30 ideas: most of them will be terrible, and that's ok, but I need to write down as many as I originally set out to. After a while of doing this, I begin to dislodge some interesting ones. I stole this method from [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/) (who is currently doing some [not-so-great stuff](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xe43y/who-the-hell-is-this-crypto-genius), but hey, his system works for me). 

How do you find new interesting ideas? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daveeday).
