Over the past 7 years, I've been lucky enough to have most of my work happen remotely, from desks in New York, Montreal, Buenos Aires, Brussels, Paris, and Milan.

That has been true for my consulting practice, as well as for [Fleisure](https://weekly.fleisure.com), whose team is fully distributed between New York, Milan, and the small town of Guastalla (pop. 15K) in Italy.

But while working remotely can afford immense benefits to both individuals and organizations, it's not easy. For one thing, it does not benefit from the decades of accumulated wisdom and best practices that have grown organically around office work. 

Playbooks for distributed teams have begun to emerge, mostly thanks to modern startups who embraced distributed teams: from [Buffer](https://open.buffer.com/no-office/), to [Doist](https://blog.doist.com/https-blog-doist-com-managing-remote-teams-622521189e80), [Customer.io](https://customer.io/blog/Lessons-from-becoming-a-remote-team.html), [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/blog/building-remote-team), and [Github](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-communicating-with-remote-teams/), just to name a few. If you dig around, you'll find [frank & open discussions](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne/status/938398704746336256) about how to think about remote salaries, and even a [good weekly newsletter](https://remotive.io/community/) dedicated solely to the topic.

I'll add my two cents. In my experience, once a remote setup is in place, teams should try to protect themselves from 3 main risks: 

1. **Communication deficit**: there is a high chance that a communication deficit may build up among the team, with small misunderstandings compounding one another. \
   \
   [One-on-ones](https://a16z.com/2012/08/30/one-on-one/) help, but I believe best way to address this problem is to encourage every one on the team to always over-communicate with each other.\
   Creating an environment in which over-communication is accepted as a necessary practice to avoid misunderstandings is an antidote to people finding it annoying or patronizing. 

2. **Big Idea freeze**: ideas just don't flow as easily in your work chat, Zoom and Google Docs as when face-to-face. Remotely, people will naturally focus on communication, problem-solving and execution, and big picture thinking will take a back seat. Even one-on-ones don't allow for too much improvisation, as they are dedicated to knocking off items off a list and catching up.\
   \
   I do not have great solutions for this yet, but asking a lot of open-ended, big-picture questions in the work chat can help. 

3. **Weaker Bonds**: humans working together in a pleasant environment tend to naturally build strong, life-long bonds. With less face time, the chances of this happening are lower.  \
   \
   The solution here, of course, is to meet up as often as possible. Even just a yearly meet-up in a different location has done wonders for our ability to connect with each other on many different levels.
