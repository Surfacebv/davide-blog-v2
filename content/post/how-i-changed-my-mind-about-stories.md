title: How I changed my mind about stories

I used to roll my eyes at people talking about "storytelling," or "the power of story." 

<!--more-->

That's odd, in retrospect. 

When I was as a journalist, my job was to find interesting [stories](http://davideberretta.tumblr.com/writings), and then write them out, packing in facts, quotes, context, and a few anecdotes.  

And later as a founder, I found myself in the role of storyteller-in-chief. My job there was to tell our company story persuasively, to users, customers, investors, journalists, teammates, myself: I had a different one for each. I even had a story for myself. 

Of course, I understood that good stories were powerful. At the dinner table, on the screen, on stage or in a book, good stories create an irresistible magnetism.  

But I still didn't "get" stories. I saw Obama, Adidas, and [Jill Soloway](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/14/dolls-and-feelings) spinning their stories with great success, but I had a hard time separating those from the money, glamour, and charisma that they came wrapped up in. So when I heard people talk about "storytelling," I ran, knowing for sure they were about to try and sell me something.  

Then a few years later, I heard Ben Thompson say something very smart, about marketing and myth-making:

>"Lots of people like to complain about marketing, it’s all fluff, and brands, blah blah blah. 

>Yes it *is* all fluff! Everything’s all fluff! That’s the point! It’s turtles all the way down. It’s all myths. It’s myths on top of myths… On a concrete business basis... that’s why advertising matters, because this sort of stuff is real, in that people have collectively decided that it’s real and that’s plenty enough."

Something clicked. The [conversation](https://soundcloud.com/exponentfm/episode-116-blockchain-2#t=11m32s) was about how people –thanks to the rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies– are beginning to see money as the social fiction that it is: it's worth something only because we all agree that it is worth something.   

But I began to see how that applied to most everything else. 

For instance, it resonated [with the idea](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/) that advertising doesn't exist to make you buy things right there and then, but rather to create a shared reality of what a product means, so that people can reference it when making buying choices. 

But that was just a small part of the puzzle. In that podcast, Thompson keeps citing [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ICN066A/), the cult book by Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari. I had heard so many people recommend it that I went ahead and bought it.

Of course, it turned out to be one of those [earthquake](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html) books.

In it, he explains why our species is so unique:

>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? 

>The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. 

>Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious myths. 

>Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths. Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees. 

>Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings."

For me, this was a eureka moment that lasted several months: it all started to come together, as I furiously underlined and re-read passages from the book. 

In modern societies, stories are so powerful and ubiquitous that we don't even see them as stories anymore. 

The most successful stories are baked into our minds, serving as the shared cognitive infrastructure of society: the state, money, religions, the law, companies are all fantastically successful stories, and branding, advertising, schooling, the military, journalism, and critical theory are all methods that serve to build up, analyze or deconstruct them. 

As a founder, I had gone down in the trenches of story and seen the man behind the curtain, which in this case, was me. I grappled every day with the inescapable truth that founders have to face: your venture is entirely sustained by your belief in the story you have created, and by how vigorously you are able to bring this vision to bear on the world around you. 

Little did I know that I was on the right path, and that's precisely how society gets made. Company myth-making is an act of willing a company into reality. Don't stop believin', or it will all deflate and crumple up, like a sad pricked balloon.
