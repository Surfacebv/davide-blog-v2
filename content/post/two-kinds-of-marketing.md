"Modern marketing, the craft of getting ideas to spread, has split," says [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/05/please-understand.html).

On the one hand, we have the optimizers. They test and measure, and will try out almost anything, until traffic and engagement go up. Their core skills are SEO, analytics, A/B tests, and the constantly evolving set of techniques to make algorithms like you on social networks.

On the other, there are the humanists: they value stories, empathy, and taste. They traffic in things that we struggle to measure, like brand voice, tone, and integrity. Most times, they are advocates for what should not be done. (Seth belongs to this [second category](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/05/please-understand.html), and is [developing tools](https://themarketingseminar.com/) for this group). 

These two groups mistrust each other. 

Many optimizers believe humanists are at best ineffective, and at worst, lazy charlatans, hiding behind the fact that their work "cannot be measured". Many humanists see optimizers as short-term thinkers who miss the big picture, constantly chasing the latest distribution fad, while eroding trust on the web by stalking and tricking users. 

Both are, to some extent, right.

But. The reason these two mistrust each other is because this split in marketing has left their managers confused: the two sides compete for the same marketing budget, and organizations will often judge the optimizers' work with humanist metrics, or vice versa. 

These are two different roles, with complementary functions. In the ferocious battle for attention and resonance that is being waged online, you will need both. Re-align incentives in your company, or hire according to what you are missing: you'll see mistrust evaporate, and powerful ideas begin to spread.
