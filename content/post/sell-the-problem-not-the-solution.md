Companies exist because of problems.

<!--more-->

The pizza shop, the cybersecurity firm, and the construction company exist to provide a scalable, cost-effective solution to the following problems:

* I'm hungry and in a hurry;
* Hackers are trying to crack my corporate network;
* the city needs a new ten-story parking lot downtown. 

Early-stage startups spend most of their time trying to zoom in on the right problem: a big enough problem guarantees demand, even when you deliver a less-than-perfect solution. [Most startups fail](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/) because they try and solve the wrong problem.  

The urgency, hairiness, and frequency of the problem your company decides to tackle will often determine its success.

Once they settle on a problem though, most companies begin taking their problem for granted, as they fall in love with their solution. 

"This problem exists. It is really bad! But here, check out our amazing solution." 

Problems are more interesting than that. They overflow with truths and insights about society, the market, and human nature, all tied up in one gordian knot. They have a history, a future, and they interact dynamically with other problems, people, and institutions.  

So especially if you work in marketing, go deep into the problem. Sit with it, and empathize with those who are experiencing it. Try to discern the myriad different shades of that problem, explore them from many different angles, and spot the stories that animate that landscape. Aim to become that problem's leading expert.

In truth, no one cares about your solution until they understand, believe, and feel the underlying problem. So don't waste an interesting problem.
