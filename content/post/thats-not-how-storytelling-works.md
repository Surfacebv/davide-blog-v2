title: That's Not How Storytelling Works

Sometimes, I'll be working with a team on a presentation, or an important piece of writing. Inevitably, someone will suggest: "let's add a little storytelling."

What this person means is: let's add, somewhere, a small anecdote that exemplifies what we are talking about, to make this content more engaging, and increase the chances it might resonate with the intended audiences. 

But that's not how stories work. 

The game, movie, book, and advertising industries know they are in the story business, and spend billions of dollars every year to discover and tell them. They hire the best screenwriters, directors, narrative designers, and creative strategists out there. And even with all that expertise, money, and credibility, many movies, campaigns, games and books still have weak stories. Those tend to flop. 

Good stories require high stakes, a complex problem, credible settings and character, a unique and original insight into the world, an understanding of narrative arcs, hooks, and much more. A few story-driven companies [manage to pull this off](https://blog.davideberretta.com/post/how-to-find-your-company-story/), and thrive.  

Most corporate storytelling, on the other hand, misses the mark: the stakes are low, and readers just don't care one way or the other. This happens because management believes that the company story is not a strategic priority, but something that can be easily added on at the margins.

Put in the work to make people care, baking story into your core company strategy. Or, if you are not ready to do that, skip the anecdote and focus on communicating with clarity.
