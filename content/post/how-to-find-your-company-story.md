Many companies¹ never find their story. Others try, but settle for a safe, half-baked one.

In these noisy times, half-baked doesn't get you far: we're overloaded with information, and our attention is under assault.

To stand out, you need a focused, powerful story that instinctively resonates with the people you want to engage, whether it's prospective customers, hires, or investors. A great company story demonstrates expertise and generates curiosity, buying you a chance to show more.

Finding this kind of story is really hard work, often harder than telling it, which is a separate process. It can take months.

But you can save yourself a lot of energy by looking for it in the right place.

Here's a few places where you *will not* find a great company story. You won't find it in the product or service you are offering. You also won't find it in the founders and the team, no matter how brilliant and interesting you are.²

So where should you look?

Your story resides in the problem you are solving.

Companies exist to solve problems in the marketplace. That is their only purpose. And your audience really cares about the problems they have. 

Problems sit at the juncture where markets, companies and people meet: they are knotty, multi-faceted, and phenomenally rich in insights about the world we live in. A well-defined, fully-understood problem is a gold mine for stories.

So here's a few ideas to help you get starte on spotting your company story:

* Try to build a [problem maze](http://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/)   
* Distill your company's initial core insight into the problem: how has the problem changed since then?
* Which parts of the problem are invisible to most participants in the market?  


To find your story, you will need to put in the work to understand or re-connect with the many different angles of the problem you are trying to solve. That work, it turns out, will give you an edge in almost every single aspect of your business.

I mostly work on this with companies, but it could just as easily be a non-profit, a city, a project, a book, or a campaign.

There are a few exceptions, one of them being if your personal story has made you well-known and respected in your industry.
