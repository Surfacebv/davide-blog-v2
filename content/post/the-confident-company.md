If you've been human for a while, you know that confidence is hard. 

<!--more-->

Confidence is closely related to our personal narrative: that's where we negotiate and align how we feel about our skills, with the feedback we get from the world outside. Gaining true confidence can take decades, as we swing back and forth between arrogant and humbled in different areas of our lives.

But the result, moving through the world with confidence, is worth it. 

This is true for companies too.  

You know, Apple. They don't say much, but when they talk or do something, they mean it. It's refreshing, and we pay attention. We trust the confident brand not to waste our time, not to beat around the bush, and to tell it like it is, for the most part. That trust turns into mindshare, and sales. 

Brands can emanate confidence, but it's the people working in the company (or the nonprofit, or the project) that build it up, slowly: year in and year out, managers and employees will observe the company fulfilling its promise to solve a problem for customers. That's necessary, but not enough. 

People in the company –the copywriter, the salesperson, the marketing manager, the customer service associate, the product manager, the CEO, and the board of directors– need to be aligned around a clear, true [story](https://blog.davideberretta.com/post/how-to-find-your-company-story/) about the company and about the world it operates in. 

Each of them also needs a certain degree of autonomy in interpreting what that vision means in their day-to-day job: more and more conversations are happening every day, at a speed that companies are not used to. Being able to participate in these conversations requires dropping the playbook and developing the right instincts. 

It's hard work, but it pays off. It's one of the reasons why Apple beats a formidable competitor like Samsung in [net promoter score](http://andrewchen.co/a-practitioners-guide-to-net-promoter-score/
